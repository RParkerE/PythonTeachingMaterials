# PythonTeachingMaterials

This repository contains teaching materials from the first session of a beginner-level Python course. It includes four lesson plans and three coding exercises that are designed to build on each other.

The course uses the book **"Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3" (4th Edition)** by Dan Bader and the Real Python team as an at-home study resource. Students are encouraged to read along with the book outside of class for additional context and practice.

## Contents

- `Session1`
  - `Lesson1.pdf` to `Lesson4.pdf`: Structured lesson plans covering core programming concepts in Python.
  - `Lesson1.py` to the python files in the `Lesson3` directory: Hands-on exercises that reinforce the lessons. These are progressive and should be completed in order.

## Goals

The primary aim of this material is to provide a clear and supportive introduction to Python for those with little or no programming experience. The lessons focus on fundamentals like variables, control flow, functions, and working with basic data types.

The exercises are intended to reinforce understanding through guided practice, with each one building on skills from the previous.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ installed
- Basic text/code editor (or just use IDLE bundel with the Python install)
- Some familiarity with the command line is helpful, but not required

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PythonTeachingMaterials.git
   cd PythonTeachingMaterials
